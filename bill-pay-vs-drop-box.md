The payment drop box has been a go-to solution for local governments looking to support citizens making in-person payments for utility bills, parking tickets, court fees, and more, after business hours. But, these drop boxes have limitations that often inconvenience both citizens and government staff. An outdoor, [self-service bill pay kiosk](https://www.adcompsystems.com/payment-kiosk.html) is a more secure and customer-friendly solution that eliminates many of the challenges associated with the municipal payment drop box.

Self-service kiosks are a viable solution that facilitates after-hours, in-person payments without the limitations of a drop box. In fact, as AdComp clients have noted, these kiosks offer many [long-term benefits](https://www.adcompsystems.com/payment-kiosk-covid19.html) for staff and citizens. Today, citizens expect their local government to provide high-quality service and a user-friendly payment experience. Therefore, itâ€™s time to let go of the payment drop box and get a kiosk.
