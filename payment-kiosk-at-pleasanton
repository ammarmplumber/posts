The City of Pleasanton has installed their new utility bill-pay kiosk at the former drive-up pay window at City Hall. The kiosk will accept credit cards, checks and cash and is available 24-hours a day, seven days a week. It will not accept payment of statements.

Those must still be paid inside. Pictured above, from left, are City Manager Johnny Huizar, Executive Assistant to the City Manager Kimberly Sanchez, Finance Director Kristi Bandy and Utilities Accounts Receivable Department workers Mari Rosa, Barbara Madison and Elena Garcia standing in front of the new kiosk at Pleasanton City Hall.
