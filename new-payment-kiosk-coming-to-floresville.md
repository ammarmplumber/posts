<!-- City of Floresville -->
The City of Floresville will be installing a new utility bill payment kiosk in late October 2020 at City Hall. The kiosk will accept credit cards, checks, and cash and will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

City Council stated, “This is one additional step the City of Floresville is taking to provide new solutions and ensure all services are made available to the citizens of Floresville, Texas.”

The Mayor and City Council are excited to offer this kiosk solution to enable customers other options to pay without entering City Hall. The new kiosk will not only protect the public health by providing a way to reduce direct contact of customers with city employees but also other members of the general public when completing any payment transactions with the City.
