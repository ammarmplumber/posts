PERFECT for families on the go or for those whose households operate outside our regular office hours, a new self-service payment kiosk is now available 24hrs a day outside the Utility Office!

This kiosk is able to take utility payments by cash, check, or credit card. Cash and check payments are FREE and credit card payments have a 2.75% credit card processing fee attached, plus a 50c user fee.

Change can be given in small bills only, and any extra amount paid will be applied to the account as a credit. The alley drop box is still available and functioning as normal.

Payments are accepted by credit or debit card, cash, or check.
