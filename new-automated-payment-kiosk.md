<!-- El Reno, OK -->
Weâ€™d like to introduce our new automated payment kiosk, set to open in late February. The kiosk will be located on the west side of City Hall and be open 24/7 for your convenience!

JACK reportedly only accepts bills and can't give change, but if someone overpays that will be used as a credit towards their next bill.

Residents say this payment center is a great idea for the Rio Bravo and El Cenizo community.

With the kiosk taking multiple forms of payments including cash, checks, MasterCard and Visa, it has never been easier to pay your water bill, municipal court fines, rent City facilities or get someone out of jail! Stay tuned for updates and tutorials!
