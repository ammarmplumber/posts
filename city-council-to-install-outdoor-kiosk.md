<!-- City of Sapulpa, OK -->
Sapulpa City Hall will soon have an electronic kiosk outside its front doors so customers can pay City bills, fees, and tickets without entering the building. The machine will take cash, cards, and checks.

The expenditure will come from the Capital Improvement Fund and was recommended for approval by the Administration and Finance Committee at their last meeting. AdComp Systems of Lewisville, Texas will install the kiosk.

Utility Billing Director Mike Hoehner says that as long as things go as planned and there are no delays in the delivery or software installation, the kiosk should be up and running around Christmas time.
