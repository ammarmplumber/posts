Recently, the city of Lake Charles, Louisiana, switched their primary online payment provider to AdComp Systems, with its enhanced features and service levels that the cityâ€™s previous vendor was unable to offer. Some of these solutions include 24/7 technical support through phone and chat, along with the ability to look up bills without an account number. AdComp also enabled Utility Express for the city, which is a text message notification platform that alerts the user when bills are generated and payments are due.

With the ability to pay bills online, payments can occur faster, there is improved tracking, transactions are transparent, and time and costs are reduced. As we love to say, convenience fosters compliance!
