LAREDO, Tex. (KGNS) - The city has set up kiosks as another payment option for water bills. To pay at the kiosk, customers will need the bill and account number. There are several locations available around town.

The kiosks are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

“This is only for your water bill,” said Noraida Negron. “So we now have different locations. We have four of them. One is right here at the City Hall. The other is at City Hall annex, the third is at the Municipal Court, and the other one is at fire station number eight which is at Del Mar.”

Payments are accepted by credit or debit card, cash, or check.
