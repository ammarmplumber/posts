Albemarle County updated its drive-thru tax kiosk outside of the county office building on McIntire Road.

Users can now get change back when paying with cash, which is something only a teller in the building could do before.

The county also simplified the machine's interface and made transactions more secure.

"We were able to use CARES funding to fund the upgrade, and again, the goal is to be able to serve more people in a contact-less fashion as we move forward," Albemarle County spokesperson Emily Kilroy said.
